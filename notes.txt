Basic idea:

Cars change their state according to a differential equation.
Mainly this is speed x time, but if they accelerate/decelerate
then it can change.

The model of the road itself can be considered a doubly linked
list, where each car links to the car in front and behind.
Skip list style markers for certain road indicators like lane
addition or removal or onramps/offramps can speed up calculation
time if needed.
