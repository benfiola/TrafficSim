# TrafficSim

While driving home to San Diego from Orange County, I thought about the feasibility of writing a traffic simulation in Java while attempting to create a very simple model for human behavior.

There's a foundation here, but it's hardly functional as is - there's a lot of re-factoring and cleanup that needs to be done.
